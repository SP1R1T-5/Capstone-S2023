#All Switches/Routers will start on 2 (S2, R2) this is due to another classmate in the same server rack
#IP address range 10.250.xxx.xxx
#Laptop = Using Windows Server VM to access the VMWare OS Config Screen due to physical laptop blocking connection to capstone network

#The past 2 weeks have been slow in terms of assignments, the week of 2/3 I had been working on a bug that crashed my Windows Server running on my VMWare Server on boot
# this issue lasted from 1/26 - 1/30.

#The Solution to the bug was the ISO used to run the Windows Server corrupted and after a new ISO was installed to the VMWare Database the Windows Server booted
# and ran after the issue.
