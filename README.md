# CapstoneS2023
#SCCC Final Semester Project

#First off Thank you for taking the time to look over this project, this is going to be my "Portfolio" if you will for Network Engineering, System Admining, and anything #else that comes my way during the process. 

Final Project Scenario:
I have been hired by a company with fewer then 10 users, the users have been storing data locally on the PCs and have been using mostly entry-level devices with no IT department. The company is expecting massive growth over the next couple months, The owner hired me to upgrade the network to a enterprise level network and secure the network to prevent any potential threats (this will be tested by other classmates attacking the network).

#I will be adding my patch notes weekly and will be updating the topology and addressing tables frequently.

#If you have any ideas for the project either leave a comment or feel free to send me an email at edwardsjonathan515@gmail.com
